Overview

This repository is aimed at JavaScript developers who want to practice and improve their understanding of algorithms and data structures. The implementations are optimized for readability and simplicity, making it a useful resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

Features

	•	Pure JavaScript Implementations: All algorithms are written in vanilla JavaScript.
	•	Wide Range of Algorithms: Covers essential algorithms and data structures such as sorting, searching, and various data structures.
	•	Well-Documented Code: Each algorithm includes comments and explanations.
	•	Test Cases Included: Most algorithms come with example test cases to verify functionality.

Installation

1.	Clone the repository:

    ```git clone https://github.com/zhukoff-av/AlgorithmsJS.git```
    ```cd AlgorithmsJS```


2.	Install dependencies:

    ```npm install```


3.	Run tests to verify the algorithms:

    ```npm test```


Usage

This repository can be used as a reference for learning algorithms, as well as a base for coding challenges and interviews. You can explore different files within the /src directory, where each algorithm and data structure is implemented in its own file.

Example usage of an algorithm:

    const { bubbleSort } = require('./src/sorting/bubbleSort');
    
    const array = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2];
    const sortedArray = bubbleSort(array);
    
    console.log(sortedArray); // Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Available Algorithms

Sorting
	
	•	Bubble Sort
	•	Insertion Sort
	•	Merge Sort
	•	Quick Sort
	•	Selection Sort

Searching
