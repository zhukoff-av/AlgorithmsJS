// You are given a binary array nums containing only the integers 0 and 1. Return the number of subarrays in nums
// that have more 1's than 0's. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.



// => Note that this problem is pretty tricky and definitely not a medium question.
//     The categorization is likely wrong on leetcode. Don’t feel bad if you don’t get it the first time.
//     It took me a whole night to figure it out.
